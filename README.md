# EudraCT reporting

The final steps of the reporting of the TALOS trial to the EudraCT database was recently performed. I used the [eudract-R-package](https://eudract-tool.medschl.cam.ac.uk) to report adverse events based on a semi-structured systematically, post-hoc, hand-coded AE reporting list monitored by an appropriate safety board and the GCP unit. 
In the EudraCT reporting folder, I have posted a RMarkdown file of my workflow in most of the data cleaning, structuring and finally formatting with the eudract package. Also included is anonymised sample data.
